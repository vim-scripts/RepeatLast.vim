" RepeatLast.vim by joeytwiddle                  (Hit 'zo' to open this fold)
"
" Provides <count>\. to repeat the last group of actions you performed.
"
"                 "A beautiful monster" -- bairui in #vim
"
" The '.' key is fantastic for repeating the last 1 action you made.  But
" sometimes I do three actions, and then want to repeat them again.  Now
" this is just 3\.
"
" BEWARE: Because it uses macro recording *all the time*, it sort of takes
" over your Vim, and can impact your usual experience.  Be prepared!
"
"   :set ch=2       if the word "recording" hides messages you wanted
"
"   :let g:RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold = 1  or  0   for GUI fixes
"
" Also: :RepeatLastDisable :RepeatLastEnable :RepeatLastToggleDebugging
"
" ** TODO **: timeSinceLast needs debugging on various systems before publishing
" this version!  reltime() is apparently non-homogenous.



" == Usage ==
"
" Assuming your mapleader is '\' (the default), these |mappings| are created:
"
"   \?   Display a list of recently recorded actions
"
"   4\?  Display the last four recorded actions
"
"   \.   Repeat the last action (similar to . but may replay just a movement)
"
"   4\.  Repeat the last four recorded actions (including movement actions)
"
"   \\.  Replay the last *repeated* action-group (all 4 actions above)
"
"   9\\. Replay the last *repeated* action-group 9 times (producing 9 times 4)
"
"   \D   Forget (drop) the last action (e.g. to discard an unwanted movement)
"
"   3\D  Drop the last 3 recorded actions (useful to get back to earlier state)
"
"   \|  or  \#
"
"        Temporarily enable/disable recording for the next few actions
"
"        (Allows free movement without adding new actions to history)
"
"   4\G  Grab the last 4 actions and store in register 'g'
"
"   @g   Repeat the actions stored in register 'g'
"
"   :let @i=@g
"
"        Copy the actions to register 'i', so 'g' may be overwritten.
"
"   :let g:RepeatLast_SaveToRegister = 'p'
"
"        Always save any repeated action-group into @p
"
"   :let g:RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold = 0
"
"        Disable the UI fix.  CursorHold events will not fire.
"
" Commands are also available for the main shortcuts above:
"
"   :ShowRecent   :RepeatLast   :DropLast   :PauseRecording   :GrabLast
"
" Commands to toggle state at runtime:
"
"   :RepeatLastEnable    Enables action recording, enters macro record mode.
"
"   :RepeatLastDisable   Disables action recording, leaves macro record mode.
"
"   :RepeatLast<Ctrl-D>  or  <Ctrl-N>      More commands, some toggle info.
"
" New feature - Auto Ignoring:
"
"   After executing a repeat action, action storage will be *temporarily
"   disabled* for the number of actions specified by:
"
"     let g:RepeatLast_Ignore_After_Use_For = 10
"
"   This allows you to move to a new location between executing repeats,
"   without recording those movement actions.
"
"   Once you have performed enough actions without executing a repeat, action
"   storage will be re-enabled, and the ignored actions will be added to the
"   history as one large entry.  Although g:RepeatLast_Stop_Ignoring_On_Edit
"   prevents this recovery.
"

" == Limitations ==
"
" It uses macro recording ALL THE TIME.  The word "recording" will forever be
" displayed in your command-line, hiding any messages usually displayed there
" by Vim's echo.  To make those hidden messages visible, you will need to:
"
"   :set cmdheight=2    or more
"
" Because recording is enabled, for commands like `q:` and `q/` you will need
" to press an extra `q` beforehand, and they will not be recorded in history.
"
" If you want to record your own macro, you can disable the plugin with
" :RepeatLastDisable (or you could try just pressing 'q' for a one-time disable).
"
" CursorHold events do not fire in macro-recording mode.  Any visual tools,
" taglist updates, etc. that require CursorHold *will not be triggered*.
" Other events such as CursorMove, InsertLeave, BufWritePost work fine.
" The new option RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold can now be used to force trigger
" of CursorHold events.  It may not be ideal, but mostly works ok.
"
" == Disadvantages ==
"
" Movements j and k will not return to the original column after passing
" through shorter lines.  (This is only a problem when using
" RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold.)
"
" Use of some <Tab>-completion plugins may produce unexpected behaviour when
" replaying actions including a <Tab>-completion.  (Although Vim's built-in
" '.' does not suffer from this.)

" When enabled, temporarily stops recording to allow Vim's 'CursorHold' event to
" trigger.  This event is used by some scripts to perform visual UI updates or
" lazy actions.  It normally triggers after 'updatetime' but if we wait that
" long, there is a good chance we will fail to record some keystrokes!
"
"   0 - Disabled.  Do not trigger CursorHold events, never lose keystrokes.
"
"   1 - Safe, recommended.  Trigger immediately after a keystroke, unless
"       user is holding down a key (if time since last action is <50ms).  (We
"       could increase this threshold a little for slower machines/users.)
"
"   2 - Simple.  Always trigger immediately after a keystroke, fires many
"       events!
"
"   3 - Lossy compromise.  Triggers after 'updatetime' if user is acting
"       slowly, or immediately if user is acting fast, or not at all if user
"       is holding down a key.  This will frequently fail to record the second
"       action, if the user hits two keys rapidly after a pause.  Pausing to
"       think is normal behaviour when recording a complex macro.  So to avoid
"       tears, train yourself: after a pause, hit the next two keys *slowly*!
"       (In other words, ensure the "recording" message re-appears before you
"       hit the second key.)
"
"   4 - Ugly compromise.  Like 3 but does a sleep instead of pausing recording
"       for updatetime, so no actions will be lost.  Whilst it generally
"       records the second keystroke (which 3 would lose), it will not break
"       out of the sleep, which is visually annoying (Vim acts unresponsive).
"
" BUG: All of the above except 0 can miss a keystroke if Vim is being slow, or
"      waiting for a multi-key, e.g. misses the  <Enter>  in  i<Esc><Enter>
"      In such cases, the keystroke is performed before we re-enter macro
"      recording mode.  "immediately" above actually means we leave recording
"      mode for 1ms, which is lossy if there are keystrokes waiting in the
"      keyboard buffer.
"
" BUG: They can also block recording of actions taken when in visual mode,
"      because CursorHold does not fire then, so our recording is not
"      re-started.  We could fix this by never triggering if we detect we are in
"      visual mode.
"
" BUG: If my <C-J> mapping is present, 4 works fine on  }j  but not on
"      }<Enter>  which gets interpreted as  }<C-J>
"
if !exists("g:RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold")
  let g:RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold = 1
endif
"
" Possible future modes (not yet implemented).
"   5 - always trigger with 0 interval (for testing, may fail in gui) (todo)
"   6 - always trigger after a fixed interval (useless)

" If set, when you repeat a group, the actions will also be saved in this

" == Bugs and TODOs ==
"
" NOTE: Increasing cmdheight is preferable to adding frequent calls to sleep,
"       which pause Vim long enough to show messages, but can slow down / lock
"       up Vim when we are pressing a lot of keys (unless I find a way to
"       check the key buffer length).  TODO: Yes, getchar(0) can do that!
"
" TODO: Change the timing of RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold according to the
"       recent typing speed of the user, so we can trigger it slowly when we
"       are confident the user won't interrupt it.  Or better, don't set a
"       longer updatetime, do a longer sleep (yes may cause freeze, but won't
"       lose any keystrokes).
"
" TODO: \| \? \. etc. should probably warn us if RepeatLast is disabled!
"
" TODO: Some of the commands are kinda useless.  Make them optional or remove them!
"
" TODO: Even using large ch and with RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold disabled,
"       warning messages such as "search hit BOTTOM" are hidden.  At least
"       offer a sleep *option* so we can see these.  Or ... echo "hidden" at
"       more opportune moments.
"
" TODO: Re-enable recording on *any* non-movement might be desirable.  At the
"       moment we only re-enable on InsertEnter changes.
"
" TODO: RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold completely fails to trigger in GUI!
"       Did it always to this?
"
" TODO: RepeatLast_Stop_Ignoring_On_Edit might not need to pre-clear the
" macro, if we detect it InsertEnter instead of InsertLeave, although that
" might lose the command that started the insert.  :P
"
" TODO: It would be convenient to add:
"
"   3\X     Delete the 3rd old action from history
"
"   3,7\X   Delete actions 3 to 7 from history (inclusive)
"
"           That stroke may not be allowed.  3\X  5 times should do it.  :-/
"
" TODO: Consider renaming "movement" to "motion" throughout the docs.
"
" Using register x, occasionally we do 'qx' to start recording but recording
" is already in progress!  This stops recording and 'x' deletes one char.
" Bad!  We need to detect whether recording is in progress or not.
" We could also use a less harmful register, but that's not the true solution.
" DONE: Since it appears Vim does not currently expose the state of recording,
" moving to a less harmful register, e.g. 'z' or 'm', might be wise.
" CONSIDER: We can at least notice when recording has been disabled, because
" the CursorHold event will eventually fire (it never fires when recording)!
"
" DONE: We could use a way to *start* recording again, if temporary Ignoring
" is enabled but unwanted.  We could just do 10 random movements.  We could
" make \# explicitly toggle (re-enable if ignoring is enabled).  On re-enable
" we may want to clear the current macro; it could well be a mix of unwanted
" and wanted.
"
" DONE: Offer a way to toggle on/off at runtime.
"
" DONE: To deal with recording of movements we don't want, an alternative
" (optional) approach might be to go modal.  After the first use of '4\.' stop
" recording (at the very least movements) so that the user can move around and
" '4\.' in other places.  Perhaps we could re-enable recording with some
" simple heuristic, like if the user makes more than 12 keystrokes without
" re-using '\.'.
"
" CONSIDER: Or we could do something like "do not officially add movement
" actions to the history *until* they are followed by an edit action".  This
" would allow us to move freely after a set of actions, and then repeat them
" without having to worry about the extra movement actions.  However it would
" also *prevent* us from ending an action-group in a movement that might move
" it to the correct place for the next movement.
"
" DONE: We might try to restore CursorHold events by periodically letting Vim
" out of recording mode, but re-enabling recording as soon as CursorHold
" fires!  A downside might be that we would fail to record keystrokes typed
" very quickly after said release (before CursorHold fires).
"
" TODO (elsewhere): Accidentally doing  80\/  instead of  80\?  throws up a
" lot of error messages: "Error detected while processing function
"            MyRepeatedSearch..MyRepeatedSearch..MyRepeatedSearch.."
" This actually comes from joey.vim.  It should fail gracefully when given a
" count.
"
" DONE: Perhaps more advanced usage, which would also avoid complications
" with *new* recordings might be to save repeated actions in a register, so it
" can be recalled without worry about ignoring new movements/actions.
" CONSIDER: We could even cycle the register used for saving, if we want to
" remember older interesting action groups.
"
" Summary of the problems with "recording" message masking 'echo'-ed lines:
"
"  1. If we start macro recording after 3 echoes but before more echoes, the
"     last of the previous 3 lines will be cleared by "recording" message
"     (although it will also be cleared itself too, by the following echoes).
"     We always see a blank line at that point (after the first 2).
"
"     We can address this by echoing a dumb line beforehand.
"
"  2. If we start macro recording at the end, before returning to the user, the
"     "recording" message appears on the last of your ch lines.  But if you
"     have N ch lines and there were *exactly* N echoes, the last one will be
"     hidden by the "recording" message.  If there were <N echoes no problem,
"     we can see them all.  If there were >N echoes, the overflow message will
"     give us a change to see them all.
"
"     (This summary is slightly inaccurate - the problem also exists if we
"     'qx' and then echo.)
"
"     (Does this problem only exist when we use RepeatLast_TriggerCursorHold?)

"     We can also address this by echoing a dumb line beforehand.  This might
"     cause "unnecessary" overflow, but it *is* needed, to see that last echo.
"
"     In either case, a dummy line is pointless if there were no previous
"     echos??
"
"     Whilst we could count our own echos, we cannot count any emitted from

" == Original development brainstorm ==

" One approach might be to record a macro *all* the time, and then take the
" last few things we need from it, when "\." is called.

" The problem is, the macro might contain 12 keys which actually represent
" only 2 actions.  For example "cwNewWord" is only one action.

" Having to interactively select how much of the macro to use will slow down
" the process, and lose the whole advantage of this feature.

" So... can we split up the keys the macro recorded into actions?
"
"   - By parsing the macro from the start, we might be able to.  Hard work.
"
"   - We could watch for mode changes such as InsertEnter, CursorHold, and
"     perhaps use these to split up our macro keys while they are being
"     generated.  Still this will leave us not knowing how to split actions
"     which do not change mode.  But it seems a great many do call
"     CursorMoved.  :)
"
"     We are taking this approach.

" Other alternatives?  Possibly by watching undo history (like UndoTree does)
" or :changes (I'm not sure we can access this), or doing raw diffs on the
" file, we might be able to crudely discover what changes the user has made,
" and convert these into repeatable actions.  Sounds pretty heavy.
